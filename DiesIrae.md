# Dies Irae - Requiem for Strings in C minor

<small>The Dies Irae, which translates to "day of wrath," is an ancient sequence used often in requiems to symbolize death and finality, also symbolizing the apocalypse. The four-note sequence is used repeatedly throughout the short piece for strings to fully embrace the imagery, inspired by other popular works following the same name, "dies irae"--Verdi's Dies Irae and Mozart's being some of the most famous.</small>
